# jojo [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/twolfson/jojo.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/twolfson/jojo)
the 10 second blog-engine for hackers (in javascript).

It was built for running as middleware inside an [express][] app but can be run standalone.

[express]: http://expressjs.com/2x/

```js
// articles/the-wonderful-wizard-of-oz.md
{
  "title": "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz",
  "author": "Lyman Frank Baum",
  "date": "1900/05/17"
}

Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry,
who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife.

// app.js
var jojo = require('jojo'),
    app = jojo();
app.listen(5000);
// Server is listening at http://localhost:5000/
// "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" is being served at `/1900-05-16-the-wonderful-wizard-of-oz`
```

## Getting started
### Middleware
`jojo` is available via npm: `npm install jojo`

`jojo` is invoked with a configuration and can return a middleware or [express][] app.

```js
var app = jojo(); // express app
var app = jojo({render: false}); // vanilla middleware
```

By default, `jojo` reads articles from `articles` directory but this can be overridden via an option.

```js
var app = jojo({articles: 'papers'}); // Read articles from `papers`
```

By default, all articles are interpretted via [marked][], a [GitHub flavored markdown][gfm] parser.

More configuration options can be found in the [documentation][].

[gfm]: http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/
[documentation]: #documentation

### Standalone
To run `jojo` as a standalone server, install `jojo` globally: `npm install -g jojo`.

`jojo` looks for a `jojo.js`/`jojo.json` to read in settings. These settings are passed to both a `jojo` middleware and [express][] app.

`jojo` also accepts arguments for choosing a different `config` or `port`.

```bash
$ jojo --help
Usage: jojo [options]
Options:
  -c, --config [config]  Config file to use (jojo.js, jojo.json)
  -p, --port [port]      Port to run server on (5000)
```

> `port` can also be specified in `jojo.js`/`jojo.json`

## Documentation
`jojo` has a wide spectrum of options


### jojo
`jojo` has an optional `options` parameter which modifies its behavior.

```js
jojo();
jojo(options);
/**
 * @param {Object} [options] Optional options to pass in to jojo
 * @returns {Function|Object} Based on options, returns a req/res/next function or express 2.x app.
 */
```

### options.render
`options.render` is expected as a `Boolean` and `true` by default.

When true, an [express 2.x][express] app will be returned by `jojo`.

Otherwise, a `req`/`res`/`next` middleware will be returned.

### options.articles
`options.articles` is expected as a `String` and `articles` by default.

This is the directory to read articles from. It is processed relative to `process.cwd()`.

### jojo.articles
`jojo.articles` is a sorted array of the parsed articles.

Each article has

- Any meta-data listed in the head of the file
- `rawContent`, unprocessed body
- `content`, formatted body
- `rawDate`, unprocessed date (from meta-data)
- `date`, `Date` object from `rawDate`
- `url`, URL path for article. This can be modified via [options.urlFormatter][urlFormatter].
- `rawSummary`, if `summary` is provided, this will be the unprocessed `summary`
- `summary`, if `summary` is provided, this will be the formatted `summary`

### req.articles, res.locals.articles
Same as `jojo.articles` but located on `req` and `res` for easy accessibility.

### req.article, res.locals.article
On article pages, this will be the corresponding `article`.

See [urlFormatter][] for more `url` information

[urlFormatter]: #jojourlformatter

### req.config, res.locals.config
Configuration passed in to `jojo`. If invoked from standalone, this will be the as the `config`.

### jojo.dataParser
`jojo.dataParser` is a `Function` to separate meta data from the body of an article.

By default, this is [json-content-demux][]. If you are overriding, return an object containing meta data on `json` and body on `content`.

[json-content-demux]: https://github.com/twolfson/json-content-demux

### jojo.formatter
`jojo.formatter` is a `Function` to process the body into HTML markup.

By default, [marked][] is used. If you are overriding, return a string of HTML.

### jojo.urlFormatter
`jojo.urlFormatter` is a `Function` that receives an article and returns a URL path.

By default, it returns `/YYYY-MM-DD-article-name`. If you are overriding, return a string.

### jojo.articleSort
`jojo.articleSort` is a `Function` that compares articles to determine their order.

By default, it returns articles by most recent. If you are overriding, you will receive two articles and need to return an integer. See [Array.prototype.sort][] documentation for more information.
