# jojo [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/twolfson/jojo.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/twolfson/jojo)
the 10 second blog-engine for hackers (in javascript).

It was built for running as middleware inside an [express][] app but can be run standalone.

[express]: http://expressjs.com/2x/

```js
// articles/the-wonderful-wizard-of-oz.md
{
  "title": "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz",
  "author": "Lyman Frank Baum",
  "date": "1900/05/17"
}

Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry,
who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife.

// app.js
var jojo = require('jojo'),
    app = jojo();
app.listen(5000);
// Server is listening at http://localhost:5000/
// "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" is being served at `/1900-05-16-the-wonderful-wizard-of-oz`
```

## Getting started
### Middleware
`jojo` is available via npm: `npm install jojo`

`jojo` is invoked with a configuration and can return a middleware or [express][] app.

```js
var app = jojo(); // express app
var app = jojo({render: false}); // vanilla middleware
```

By default, `jojo` reads articles from `articles` directory but this can be overridden via an option.

```js
var app = jojo({articles: 'papers'}); // Read articles from `papers`
```

By default, all articles are interpretted via [marked][], a [GitHub flavored markdown][gfm] parser.

More configuration options can be found in the [documentation][].

### Standalone
To run `jojo` as a standalone server, install `jojo` globally: `npm install -g jojo`.

`jojo` looks for a `jojo.js`/`jojo.json` to read in settings. These settings are passed to both a `jojo` middleware and [express][] app.

`jojo` also accepts arguments for choosing a different `config` or `port`.

```bash
$ jojo --help
Usage: jojo [options]
Options:
  -c, --config [config]  Config file to use (jojo.js, jojo.json)
  -p, --port [port]      Port to run server on (5000)
```

> `port` can also be specified in `jojo.js`/`jojo.json`

## Documentation
`jojo` has a wide spectrum of options

```js
jojo();
jojo(options);
@param {Object} [options] Optional options to pass in to jojo
@returns {Function|Object} Depending on the options, returns a req/res/next function or express 2.x app.
```

```js
@param {Boolean} [options.render=true] By default, triggers return of express 2.x app. Otherwise, returns req/res/next middleware.
```
